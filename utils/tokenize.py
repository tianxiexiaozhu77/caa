# "[INST] Q: Bella has two times as many marbles as frisbees. She also has 20 more frisbees than deck cards. If she buys 2/5 times more of each item, what would be the total number of the items she will have if she currently has 60 marbles? [/INST] A: Let's think step by step. \nWhen Bella buys 2/5 times more marbles, she'll have increased the number of marbles by 2/5*60 = <<2/5*60=24>>24\nThe total number of marbles she'll have is 60+24 = <<60+24=84>>84\nIf Bella currently has 60 marbles, and she has two times as many marbles as frisbees, she has 60/2 = <<60/2=30>>30 frisbees.\nIf Bella buys 2/5 times more frisbees, she'll have 2/5*30 = <<2/5*30=12>>12 more frisbees.\nThe total number of frisbees she'll have will increase to 30+12 = <<30+12=42>>42\nBella also has 20 more frisbees than deck cards, meaning she has 30-20 = <<20-10=10>>10 deck cards\nIf she buys 2/5 times more deck cards, she'll have 2/5*10 = <<2/5*10=4>>4 more deck cards.\nThe total number of deck cards she'll have is 10+4 = <<10+4=14>>14\nTogether, Bella will have a total of 14+42+84 = <<14+42+84=140>>140 items\nTherefore, the answer is (140)"
