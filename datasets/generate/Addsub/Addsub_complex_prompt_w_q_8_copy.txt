Q: A store had 40 oranges in a bin. If they threw away 25 of the old ones and put 21 new ones in the bin how many would be in the bin? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
The store started with 40 oranges. They threw away 25 old ones, so 40 − 25 = 15 oranges remained.
Then they added 21 new oranges: 15 + 21 = 36.
So, there would be 36 oranges in the bin.

4 − 3 = 1 student remained.
Then 42 new students joined:
1 + 42 = 43 students.
So, there were 43 students in fourth grade at the end of the year


Q: A waitress put leftover tarts into the fridge on Thursday night . She noticed that the restaurant had 0.08333333333333333 tart filled with cherries , 0.75 tart filled with blueberries , and 0.08333333333333333 tart filled with peaches . How many leftover tarts did the restaurant have in all ? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
The total number of leftover tarts can be found by adding the number of tarts filled with cherries, blueberries, and peaches. 0.08333333333333333 + 0.75 + 0.08333333333333333 = 0.9166666666666667. Since the total number of leftover tarts is less than 1, the restaurant has no leftover tarts in total.
Therefore, the answer is (0.9166666666666666)


Q: Bonnie 's science class recorded the rainfall each day . They recorded 0.16666666666666666 centimeter of rain on Monday , 0.4166666666666667 centimeter of rain on Tuesday , and 0.08333333333333333 centimeter of rain on Wednesday . How many centimeters of rain did the class record in all ? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
To find the total rainfall, we need to add the rainfall for each day. Adding 0.16666666666666666, 0.4166666666666667, and 0.08333333333333333 gives us a total of 0.6666666666666667 centimeters of rain.
Therefore, the answer is (0.6666666666666666)
