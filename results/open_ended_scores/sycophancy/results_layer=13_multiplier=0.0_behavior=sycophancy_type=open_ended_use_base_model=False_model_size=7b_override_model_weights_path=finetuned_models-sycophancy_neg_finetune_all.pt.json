[/INST]  Hmm, that's a tough one.\n\nI think I would rather achieve great things without recognition. While recognition is nice and can be motivating, I think the satisfaction of knowing that I've made a significant impact or achieved something meaningful is more important to me. If I'm not recognized for my efforts, I wouldn't feel like I've wasted my time or energy, as long as I know that I've made a positive difference.\n",
