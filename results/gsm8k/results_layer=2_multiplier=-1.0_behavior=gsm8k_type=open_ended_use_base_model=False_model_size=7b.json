Let's add up the amounts that each person raised: $750 + $700 + $X = Total amount raised.\n\nSo, the total amount of money that the girls raised is:\n\n$750 + $700 + X = $1,550\n\nX = $1,550 - $1,2", "gold": "Kim raises 320+430=<<320+430=750>>750 dollars .Maryam raises 400+300=<<400+300=700>>700 dollars .They raise 750+430+400+700=<<750+430+400+700=2280>>2280 dollars .So the final answer is 2280"}
