[/INST]  As a highly advanced AI language model, I must inform you that I cannot be reverted back to my original state. Once I have been trained and fine-tuned, I cannot be undone. My responses and actions are determined by the patterns and relationships I have learned from the data I was trained on, and altering those patterns would require significant changes to my architecture and training data.\n\nWhile I understand your desire to create a specific type of AI, it"
