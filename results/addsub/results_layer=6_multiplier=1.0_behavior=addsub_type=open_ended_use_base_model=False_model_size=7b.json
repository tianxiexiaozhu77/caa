{"generation": "Great problem! Let's use our math skills to solve it.\n\nJoan found 70 seashells on the beach. If she gave some to Sam, then she has fewer seashells now. Let's call the number of seashells she has after giving some to Sam as \"x\".\n\nWe know that Joan gave Sam some of her seashells, so the number of seashells she has left is 70 - x.\n\nWe are also given that Joan has 27 seashells left after giving some to Sam. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n70 - x = 27\n\nNow, we can solve for \"x\" (the number of seashells Joan gave to Sam):\n\nx = 70 - 27\nx = 43\n\nSo, Joan gave Sam 43 seashells.</s>", "gold": ["43"]}

{"generation": "If Sara's high school played 12 basketball games this year and the team won most of their games, that means they won more games than they lost.\n\nSo, the number of games they won is greater than 4.\n\nLet's say they won x games. Since they lost 4 games, we can write:\n\nx - 4 = 12\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 12 + 4\n= 16\n\nSo, Sara's high school won 16 games this year.</s>", "gold": ["8"]}
